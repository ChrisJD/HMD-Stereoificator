		All simple states can be tracked by the device. This is basically all states that are basic value types rather 
		than interfaces (For example, everything set by SetSamplerState).


		Any states that are wrapped need to have the wrapped state stored. (Textures, Vertex/Pixel Shaders, etc.)

		For stereo components like Textures all parameters needed to manually re-apply them need to be saved (textures only 
		need the texture and the number of the sampler the texture is in). This is because we can't guarantee that all states
		will be saved while the same side is active. If all states were saved on the same side then the stereo components won't 
		need to be reapplied and the procedure will be the same as for non-stereo components stated below.

		Non-stereo componenets like Vertex Buffers and Shaders just need the wrapper reference stored in order to be able
		to restore the wrapper in the device proxy. The actual state will be restored on the device by the actual StateBlock.


		View, projection and world matrix because we keep a left and right version. (TODO World matrix might be world-view 
		in which case there will be left and right versions. Don't have a good way to handle this yet (or a test case), 
		leaving world matrix to actual device for now)
