Stereoificator Change Log.

-Clean install needed, don't install over existing without overwriting all files and deleting existing users.xml as xml layout has changed significantly.
-Moved a lot of the cfg options from profiles.xml into users.xml. (users.xml will be generated the first time Stereoificator is run now, it also shouldn't need to be overwritten in the future so settings shouldn't get lost with each new version (no promises))
-Shift-F6 resets all user.xml settings to defaults.
-HUD reprojection in Source (making the HUD float in 3D space). Adjust distance with F4/F5 and size with ctrl-F4/ctrl-F5


v0.01.0001a (unstable)
-Experimenting with HUD reprojection in Source (making the HUD float in 3D space). 
F5 moves HUD away from player position, F4 moves it towards the player. 
ctrl+F5 scales the HUD up, ctrl-F4 scales it down 
It would be much better if individual HUD elements were being scaled up, but that's a lot more work to implement. Not sure if anything will actually be readable in the Rift as it is here.

-Changed deafult yaw and pitch multipliers for Dear Esther based on the same post.
